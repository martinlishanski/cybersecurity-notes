# Martin Lishanski — Cybersecurity Learning Journey

I am transitioning into cybersecurity with the goal of working as a Blue Team / SOC Analyst.

I currently work in IT systems support and monitoring, where I monitor services, investigate incidents, and troubleshoot issues in production environments. This pushed me to go deeper into how systems fail, how attacks look in logs, and how defenders actually detect and respond to them.

This repository documents my personal study notes, labs, and practical exercises while I build the skills required for an entry-level SOC position.
